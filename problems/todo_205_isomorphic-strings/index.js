description: > 
  Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
  Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
  All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character 
  while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character 
  but a character may map to itself.
